# a vehicle on the main highway should change to the left to help vehicles on the ramp with merging.
blocker_on_main_frees_lane

# This test shows undesireable dynamics:
# A brakes to let B merge but B breaks as well so it does not help
blocker_on_main_brakes

# This test shows undesireable dynamics:
# A brakes to let B merge but A is much to fast for this to be useful
blocker_on_main_brakes2

# This test shows undesireable dynamics:
# This is an expanded case of test 'blocker_on_main_brakes2'
# A flow of vehicles on the main road tries to help a vehicle merge from the ramp.
# Everyone brakes only a little but this accumulates into a standstill on the main highway.
blocker_on_main_brakes3

# This test shows undesireable dynamics:
# This is similar to test 'blocker_on_main_brakes3' but now the main road has two lanes with parallel flows.
# The right flow of vehicles brakes to help a vehicle merge from the ramp. 
# The reason here is that they all try to help with merging by changing lanes themselves which causes them to brake until standstill.
