# The following subfolders test whether setting a different simulation begin affects the program
# Of course, this should not be the case, the program should be same (in case of static tls),
# independent of the time the simulation starts at
# We do not need vehicle movement as we only watch the tls switch

# Simulation starts at 0
begin0

# Simulation starts at 50
begin50

# Simulation starts at 100
begin100

# switch tls off

# switch all tls off with option
all_off

# Tests for error handling
errors

# test tlLogic type "actuated"
actuated

# TLS actuation based on the individual vehicle's time losses
delay_based

# test NEMA-compliant traffic controller
NEMA

# test dynamics when the node type was set to "traffic_light_unregulated"

# load another offset value for an existing traffic light

# load another offset value for a non existing traffic light
