# Overview

Since version 0.24.0 SUMO includes a model for electric vehicles. It was
implemented by Tamás Kurczveil and Pablo Álvarez López from the
[TU-Braunschweig](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/). The core of the
model is implemented in the [vehicle
device](../Developer/How_To/Device.md) *device.battery*. Additional
features are a charging station (which can be placed on any lane in the
network) and a new output option **--battery-output** {{DT_FILE}}.

You can find a test case for these implementations at
[\[1\]](http://sumo.dlr.de/trac.wsgi/browser/trunk/sumo/tests/sumo/extended/electric/braunschweig)

# Defining Electric Vehicles

To define an electric vehicle, it must be equipped with a battery
device. This may be done using the option **--device.battery.explicit <vehID1,vehID2,...\>** or simply setting **--device.battery.probability 1** to equip
all vehicles. Alternatively, the device may be specified using [Generic
vehicle
parameters](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#devices).

Additional properties of the vehicle and its electrical components must
then be defined via [parameters of the vehicle or its
type](../Simulation/GenericParameters.md).

These values have the following meanings:

| key                     | Value Type | Default    | Description                                             |

| maximumPower            | float      | 0 (W)      | Maximum power which the vehicle can reach               |
| vehicleMass             | float      | 0 (kg)     | Vehicle mass *m<sub>veh</sub>*                          |
| frontSurfaceArea        | float      | 0 (m2)     | Front surface area *A<sub>veh</sub>*                    |
| airDragCoefficient      | float      | 0          | Air drag coefficient *c<sub>w</sub>*                    |
| internalMomentOfInertia | float      | 0 (kg·m2)  | Mom. of inertia of int. rot. elements *J<sub>int</sub>* |
| radialDragCoefficient   | float      | 0          | Radial drag coefficient c<sub>rad</sub>                 |
| rollDragCoefficient     | float      | 0          | Rolling resistance coefficient *c<sub>roll</sub>*       |
| constantPowerIntake     | float      | 0 (W)      | Avg. (constant) power of consumers *P<sub>const</sub>*  |
| propulsionEfficiency    | float      | 0          | Drive efficiency *η<sub>prop</sub>*                     |
| recuperationEfficiency  | float      | 0          | Recuperation efficiency *η<sub>recup</sub>*             |
| stoppingTreshold        | float      | 0.1 (km/h) | Minimum velocity to start charging                      |

An example of a vehicle with electric attribute:

```
<routes>
    <vType id="ElectricBus" accel="1.0" decel="1.0" length="12" maxSpeed="100.0" sigma="0.0" minGap="2.5" color="1,1,1">
        <param key="has.battery.device" value="true"/>
        <param key="maximumBatteryCapacity" value="2000"/>
        <param key="maximumPower" value="1000"/>
        <param key="vehicleMass" value="10000"/>
        <param key="frontSurfaceArea" value="5"/>
        <param key="airDragCoefficient" value="0.6"/>
        <param key="internalMomentOfInertia" value="0.01"/>
        <param key="radialDragCoefficient" value="0.5"/>
        <param key="rollDragCoefficient" value="0.01"/>
        <param key="constantPowerIntake" value="100"/>
        <param key="propulsionEfficiency" value="0.9"/>
        <param key="recuperationEfficiency" value="0.9"/>
        <param key="stoppingTreshold" value="0.1"/>
    </vType>
</routes>
```

The initial energy content of the battery (by default MaxBatKap/2) can
be set in the vehicle definitions

```
<routes>
    <vehicle id="0" type="type1" depart="0" color="1,0,0">
        <param key="actualBatteryCapacity" value="500"/>
    </vehicle>
</routes>
```

# Vehicle behavior

Vehicle behavior will not be affected by battery level. Car will keep driving even when their battery capacity is at 0. To avoid this [TraCI](#traci) must be used to change speed or route based on the current battery level.

# Charging Stations

A charging station is a surface defined on a lane in which the vehicles
equipped with a battery are charged. The basic structure and parameters
of bus stops were used for the implementation of charging stations.

| key                 | Value Type | Value range                                                                                | Default   | Description         |

| **power**           | float  (W/h) or (ml/s)  | power \> 0  | 0  | Charging power *P<sub>chrg</sub>*  (If the battery device being charged  [is configured to track fuel](#tracking_fuel_consumption_for_non-electrical_vehicles), charging power will be interpreted as ml/s)  |

Charging stations are defined in additional using the following format:

```
<additional>
    <chargingStation chargeDelay="2" chargeInTransit="0" power="200000" efficiency="0.95" endPos="25" id="cS_2to19_0a" lane="2to19_0" startPos="10"/>
</additional>
```

And are represented in the simulation as shown:

![](../images/ChargingStation.png "Representation of chargingStation in GUI")
Representation of chargingStation in GUI

![](../images/ChargingStationCharging.png "Color of chargingStation during charge")
Color of chargingStation during charge

## Stopping at a Charging Station

A stop at a charging station may occur due to traffic conditions,
stopping at a defined location or stopping at an explicit
chargingStation as defined below:

```
<routes>
    <vehicle id="v0" route="route0" depart="0">
        <stop chargingStation="myChargingStationID" until="50"/>
    </vehicle>
</routes>
```

## Charging Station output

Option --chargingstations-output "nameOfFile.xml" generates a full
report of energy charged by charging stations:

```
<output>
    <battery-output value="battery.xml"/>
    <chargingstations-output value="chargingstations.xml"/>
</output>
```

File chargingstations.xml has the following structure:

```

# battery-output

There are three output parameters to be set in the SUMO configuration to
use the battery device:

```
<configuration>
    <input>
        <net-file value="netFile.xml"/>
        <route-files value="routeFile.xml"/>
        <additional-files value="additionalFile.xml"/>
    </input>
    <output>
        <battery-output value="Battery.out.xml"/>
        <battery-output.precision value="4"/>
        <device.battery.probability value="1"/>
        <summary-output value="summary_100.xml"/>
    </output>
</configuration>
```

The battery-output generates a file with this structure:

# Emission Output

The [Emission model](../Models/Emissions.md#outputs)-outputs of
SUMO can be used together with the battery device when setting the
`<vType>`-parameter `emissionClass="Energy/unknown"`.

# Tracking fuel consumption for non-electrical vehicles

By setting option **--device.battery.track-fuel**, equipped vehicles with a convential drive train (emissionClass other than `Energy`) will monitor their fuel level based on the fuel consumption of their respective emission class. All capacity values are then interpreted as ml instead of Wh. Also, the chargingStation power is re-interpreted as ml/s when charging fuel.

# TraCI

The internal state of the battery device can be accessed directly using
[*traci.vehicle.getParameter*](../TraCI/Vehicle_Value_Retrieval.md#supported_device_parameters)
and
[*traci.vehicle.setParameter*](../TraCI/Change_Vehicle_State.md#supported_device_parameters).

Furthermore, the function
[*traci.vehicle.getElectricityConsumption()*](../TraCI/Vehicle_Value_Retrieval.md#command_0xa4_get_vehicle_variable)
can be used to access the consumption of the vehicle if the `emissionClass="Energy/unknown"` [is
declared](#emission_output).

## Calculating the remaining Range:

After the vehicle has been driving for a while, the remaining range can be computed based on previous consumption and distance:
```
mWh = traci.vehicle.getDistance(vehID) / float(traci.vehicle.getParameter(vehID, "device.battery.totalEnergyConsumed"))
remainingRange = float(traci.vehicle.getParameter(vehID, "device.battery.actualBatteryCapacity")) * mWh
```
To compute the remaining range on departure, the value of `mWh` (meters per Watt-hour) should be calibrated from a prior simulation.

Observations:
- Simulation efficiencies of 6.3 - 6.7 km driven per kWh consumed agree with measured efficiences of 6.4 - 6.8 (stddev 0.4 - 0.8) in short and medium range simulations with realistic traffic
- abstract scenarios without junctions and other cars overestimate the efficency by a large factor (~ twice as many km/kWh)
