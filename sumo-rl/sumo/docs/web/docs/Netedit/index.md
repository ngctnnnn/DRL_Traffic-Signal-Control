# From 30.000 feet

**netedit** is a graphical network editor included in SUMO.

- **Purpose:** create and modify SUMO networks
- **System:** portable (Linux/Windows is tested); opens a window
- **Input (optional):** road network definitions to import
- **Output:** A generated SUMO-road network; optionally also other outputs
- **Programming Language:** C++

# Usage Description

**netedit** is a visual network editor. It can be used to create networks from scratch and to modify all aspects of existing networks. With a powerful selection and highlighting interface it can also be used to debug network attributes. **netedit** is built on top of [netconvert](../netconvert.md). As a general rule of thumb, anything [netconvert](../netconvert.md) can do, **netedit** can do as well. **netedit** has unlimited undo/redo capabilities and thus allows editing mistakes to be quickly corrected. Editing commands are generally issued with a left-click (according to the current [edit mode](editModes.md)). The user interface closely follows that of [sumo-gui](../sumo-gui.md#interaction_with_the_view). Additional keyboard hotkeys are documented in the *Help* menu.

**netedit** can also be used to define and edit:

- [additional simulation infrastructure](elementsAdditional.md)
- [traffic (vehicles, persons, vTypes, routes)](elementsDemand.md)
- [network related data](elementsData.md)
- [shape data](elementsShape.md)

## Input

**netedit** is a GUI-Application and inputs are chosen via menus. The following input formats are supported:

- SUMO-net files
- OSM-files
- [netconvert](../netconvert.md)-configuration files

## Output

- SUMO-net files
- plain-xml files

In addition to these hotkeys, [all hotkeys for moving and zooming in
sumo-gui](../sumo-gui.md#keyboard_shortcuts) are supported.

## Processing Menu Options

- **Compute Junctions** (F5): recomputes the geometry and logic of all junctions. This is triggered automatically when entering modes which require this information (Connect, Traffic Lights).
- **Clean Junctions** (F6): removes all junctions that do not have any adjacent edges (These junctions are not included when saving the network. They are kept in the editor until cleaned for potential reuse).
- **Join Selected Junctions** (F7): joins the selected junctions into a single junction (See [joining junctions](../Networks/PlainXML.md#joining_nodes)).
- **Options** (F10): inspect and set all options. These are the same options that [netconvert](../netconvert.md) accepts on the commandline or in a configuration.

## Customizing Visualization

Most of the visualization options that are available in [sumo-gui](../sumo-gui.md#changing_the_appearancevisualisation_of_the_simulation) can also be set in netedit. This includes the facilities for [loading
background images](../sumo-gui.md#showing_background_images). It is also possible to load [POIs and Polygons](elementsShape.md) using the menu *File-> Additionals and Shapes-> Load Additionals*.

### Background Grid

When activating the background grid via the visualization settings dialog ![](../images/Colorwheel.gif) or via the *show grid* option in [Create Edge Mode](editModesNetwork.md#create_edges), all clicks that create or move objects will snap to the nearest grid point. The resolution of the grid can be
customized in the *Background*-Tab of the visualization settings dialog. By using hotkey **Ctrl-PageUp** the grid spacing is doubled and with **Ctrl-PageDown** the grid size is reduce by a factor of 2.

## Terminology

The main network elements that are used to represent a road network in SUMO are [edges, lanes, junctions, connections, traffic
lights](../Networks/SUMO_Road_Networks.md). [Additional infrastructure elements](elementsAdditional.md) such as bus stops, detectors and variable speed signs are kept in separate files and
loaded at the start of the simulation. In SUMO the terms **node** and **junction** and **intersection** are used interchangeably (in netedit the term junction is used throughout).

# Editing Modes

Netedit can be switched between three major edit modes (also called ***supermodes***) for editing [network](editModesNetwork.md)-related objects, [traffic](editModesDemand.md)-related objects and [data](editModesData.md) objects.
Each of these [supermodes](editModes.md) has a number of sub-modes (simply called ***modes***) for inspecting, deleting and adding the different objects.
Some of these modes are common to all supermodes while others are specific to a particular supermode as listed below.

## [Common modes](editModesCommon.md)

This modes are present in all supermodes and have custom cursors:

- [Inspect](editModesCommon.md#inspect)
- [Delete](editModesCommon.md#delete)
- [Select](editModesCommon.md#select)
- [Move](editModesCommon.md#move) (absent in *Data Supermode*)
 
## [Network specific modes](editModesNetwork.md)

Modes available in the *Network Supermode*:

- [Edges](editModesNetwork.md#create_edges)
- [Connections](editModesNetwork.md#edit_connections)
- [Prohibitions](editModesNetwork.md#prohibitions)
- [Traffic Lights](editModesNetwork.md#traffic_lights)
- [Additionals (busStops, detectors, ...)](editModesNetwork.md#additionals)
- [Crossings](editModesNetwork.md#crossings)
- [TAZ](editModesNetwork.md#taz_traffic_analysis_zones)
- [Shapes (POI, Poly)](editModesNetwork.md#shapes)
 
## [Demand specific modes](editModesDemand.md)

Modes available in the *Demand Supermode*:

- [Routes](editModesDemand.md#route_mode)
- [Vehicles](editModesDemand.md#vehicle_mode)
- [Vehicle Types](editModesDemand.md#vehicle_type_mode)
- [Stops](editModesDemand.md#stop_mode)
- [Person Types](editModesDemand.md#person_type_mode)
- [Persons](editModesDemand.md#person_mode)
- [Person Plans](editModesDemand.md#person_plan_mode)

## [Data specific modes](editModesData.md)

Modes available in the *Data Supermode*:

- [Edge Data](editModesData.md#edge_data_mode)
- [Edge Relation](editModesData.md#edge_rel_data_mode)
- [TAZ Relation](editModesData.md#taz_relation_mode)

# [Elements](elements.md)

Netedit is used to create and edit a variety of different objects. Each object may support additional functionality:

- [Network elements](elementsNetwork.md)
- [Additional elements](elementsAdditional.md)
- [Shape Elements](elementsShape.md)
- [TAZ elements](elementsTAZ.md)
- [Demand elements](elementsDemand.md)
- [Data elements](elementsData.md)

# [Popup-Menu functions](neteditPopupFunctions.md)

Right clicking over an element will open a popup-menu with functions and operations relevant to set element. You can right click on:

- [Edge and Lane](neteditPopupFunctions.md#edge_and_lane)
- [Junction](neteditPopupFunctions.md#junction)
- [Connection](neteditPopupFunctions.md#connection)
- [Crossing](neteditPopupFunctions.md#crossing)

# [Usage examples](neteditUsageExamples.md)

- [Reducing the extent of a network](neteditUsageExamples.md#reducing_the_extent_of_the_network)
- [Specifying the complete geometry of an edge including endpoints](neteditUsageExamples.md#specifying_the_complete_geometry_of_an_edge_including_endpoints)
- [Converting an intersection into a roundabout](neteditUsageExamples.md#converting_an_intersection_into_a_roundabout)
- [Correcting road access permissions](neteditUsageExamples.md#correcting_road_access_permissions)
- [Creating bidirectional railway tracks](neteditUsageExamples.md#creating_bidirectional_railway_tracks)

And many [others](neteditUsageExamples.md).

# Planned Features

- Support for editing features already supported by [netconvert](../netconvert.md)
  - Editing `<neigh>` information for [Simulation/OppositeDirectionDriving](../Simulation/OppositeDirectionDriving.md)
    

!!! note
        Currently, you may either switching on **--opposites.guess** via the [F10-menu](#processing_menu_options) or set lane attribute 'oppositeID'.
    
- Editing [walkingarea shapes](../Networks/PlainXML.md#walking_areas)
- Integration of [netgenerate](../netgenerate.md)
- Integration of [netdiff](../Tools/Net.md#netdiffpy)
- Adding / merging of sub-networks to the existing network
