title: EmissionOutput
---

The reason for this output option is the possibility of SUMO to
calculate emission for every simulation timestep. The calculated values
for every vehicle will be recorded and can be used for a more
sophisticated view on special parts of the network. The values depend on
the selected [emission models](../../Models/Emissions.md) for the
individual vehicles.

## Instantiating within the Simulation

To force SUMO to build a file that contains the emission output, extend
your command line (or configuration) parameter by **--emission-output** {{DT_FILE}}. {{DT_FILE}} is the name of the
file the output will be written to. Any other file with this name will
be overwritten, the destination folder must exist.

By default, emission-output is enabled for all vehicles in the
simulation with output in each simulation step. Using [device assignment
options or
parameters](../../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#devices)
(i.e. **--device.emissions.probability 0.25**) the set of vehicles which generate emission output can be reduced.
The output period can be set by using option **--device.emissions.period** {{DT_TIME}}.

## Generated Output

The emission output is a xml-file containing the emission values for
each time step for every vehicle. The produced XML File looks like this:

```
<emission-export>

 <timestep time="<TIME_STEP>">

  <vehicle id="<VEHICLE_ID>" eclass="<VEHICLE_EMISSION_CLASS>" CO2="<VEHICLE_CO2>" CO="<VEHICLE_CO>"
    HC="<VEHICLE_HC>" NOx="<VEHICLE_NOX>" PMx="<VEHICLE_PMX>" fuel="<VEHICLE_FUEL>" electricity="<VEHICLE_ELECTRICITY>" noise="<VEHICLE_NOISE>" \
    route="<VEHICLE_ROUTE>" type="<VEHICLE_TYPE>" waiting="<VEHICLE_WAITING>" lane="<VEHICLE_LANE>" \
    pos="<VEHICLE_POS>" speed="<VEHICLE_SPEED>" angle="<VEHICLE_ANGLE>" x="<VEHICLE_POS_X>" y="<VEHICLE_POS_Y>"/>

   ... more vehicles ...

  </timestep>

... the next timestep ...

</emission-export>
```

!!! caution
    When running with sub-second resolution, the emissions written during every simulation step are extrapolated to those that would be generated in 1 second. To avoid scaling (and thus simplify aggregation), set option **--emission-output.step-scaled**
