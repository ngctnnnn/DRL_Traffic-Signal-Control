## Instantiating within the Simulation

Stop output is activated by setting the simulation option **--stop-output** {{DT_FILE}} on the
command line or in a *.sumocfg* file. This output contains the
information about each vehicle's scheduled
[`<stop>`](../../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#stops):
time of arrival and departure, stopping place and number of persons or
container that were loaded and unloaded. The information is generated
every time a stop ends.

## Generated Output

The format is the following:

```xml
<stops>
    <stopinfo ''ATTRIBUTES''...\>
    ...
</stops>
```

The following output attributes are generated:
