## accelerations.py

Script for computing aggregate statistics about vehicle accelerations
based on [--netstate-dump](../Simulation/Output/RawDump.md) output.

## vehLanes.py

Script for computing
[vehroute](../Simulation/Output/VehRoutes.md)-like output for lanes
based on [--netstate-dump](../Simulation/Output/RawDump.md) output.
Output data also includes information about the number of lane changes
for each vehicle.

usage:

```
python vehLanes.py <netstate_dump.xml> <output_file>
```

## edgeDataDiff.py

Computes the numerical difference of
[edgeData](../Simulation/Output/Lane-_or_Edge-based_Traffic_Measures.md)
values for each edge and interval. The resulting file can be used to
[visualize changes between two traffic scenarios](../sumo-gui.md#visualizing_edge-related_data). Both
input files must contain the same edges and intervals.

usage:

```
python edgeDataDiff.py <edgeData1.xml> <edgeData2.xml> <diffFile.xml>
```

## vehrouteDiff.py

Computes the difference in travel times between two sets of **--vehroute-output** files. The
files must contain the same vehicles and the same routes and may only
differ in travel times. The must have been generated with the option **--vehroute-output.exit-times**
for the script to work.

usage:

```
python vehrouteDiff.py routes1.rou.xml routes2.rou.xml result.xml
```

## tripinfoDiff.py

Computes the difference in travel times, route length, time loss,
departure- and arrival times between two sets of **--tripinfo-output** files. The files
should contain the same vehicles.

usage:

```
python tripinfoDiff.py tripinfos1.xml tripinfos2.xml result.xml
```

By default only `<tripinfo>` elements are considered. By setting option **--persons**, the
difference for `<personinfo>` elements is computed instead.

## tripinfoByTAZ.py

Aggregates tripinfo data by origin/destination TAZ. The TAZ data can
either by taken from the original input file (if it contains 'fromTaz'
and 'toTaz' attributes) or from a TAZ file.

```
python tripinfoByTAZ.py -t tripinfos.xml -r trips.xml
python tripinfoByTAZ.py -t tripinfos.xml -z taz.axml
```

By default traveltime (tripinfo attribute 'duration') is aggregated.
Other attributes can be selected using option **--attribute** (e.g. 'routeLength').
Output is given as plain text on the command line or in xml format if
option **--output** is set.

## tripinfoByType.py

Aggregates tripinfo data by vType and person stage type for the given attribute

```
python tripinfoByType.py -t tripinfos.xml -a timeLoss

```

Output is given as plain text on the command line or in xml format if option **--output** is set.

## attributeStats.py

Computes statistics on an arbitrary numerical attribute in a flat xml
document. (eg. attribute *timeLoss* for element *tripinfo* in
[tripinfo-output](../Simulation/Output/TripInfo.md)) and writes the
results to standard output. When the attribute contains time data in HH:MM:SS format, the values will automatically be converted to seconds.

```
python tools/output/attributeStats --element tripinfo --attribute timeLoss input.xml
```

With option **--hist-output** {{DT_FILE}} a histogram data file (e.g. for plotting with gnuplot) is
generated.

It is also possible to give multiple files as input as a space separated list or via shell expenasion (i.e. `*.input.xml`)

## computeCoordination.py

This tool reads fcd-output and a corridor definition. It computes the fraction of vehicles that passed the corridor without significant slow-down.

Example:
```
python tools/output/computeCoordination.py --fcd-file fcd.xml --filter-route B,C,D,E --entry C --min-speed 5
```
This computes the fraction of vehicles that passed the edges *B,C,D,E* in order (possibly with gaps) and were delayed after passing edge *C* to less then 5m/s.

With option **--full-output** {{DT_FILE}} Each vehicle that passed the corridor is recorded with entry time and the time at which it was delayed (-1 it it was not delayed).

## tripStatistics.py

This script is to calculate the global performance indices according to
**SUMO-based** simulation results. The calculation functions are
directly defined in this script. Basic statistics are delivered, such
as:

- average travel time (s)
- average travel length (m)
- average travel speed (m/s)
- average departure delay (s)
- average waiting time (s)

Besides, this script is also to execute a significance test for
evaluating the results from different assignment methods. The t test and
the Kruskal-Wallis test are available in this script. If not specified,
the Kruskal-Wallis test will be applied with the assumption that data
are not normally distributed.

In order to execute this script, the other two scripts, i.e.
statisticsElements.py and tables.py, are required. They all should be in
the same directory.

In the statisticsElements.py, classes regarding vehicles, their
performance measures, t values, H values as well as functions for
outputs are defined. The chi-square table and the t table are defined in
the tables.py.

An exemplary command is shown below.

```
python tools/output/tripStatistics.py -t <tripinfo files> -o <output file> -e

where -t: name of output files containing vehicle information, generated by SUMO
      -o: define the output file name
      -e: set true for applying the t test (default: false)
      -k: set true for applying the Kruskal-Wallis test (default: false)
```

## computeStoppingPlaceUsage.py
This tool reads stop-output and generates occupancy-over-time for stopping places (i.e. parkingArea).
A distinct output file will be created for each stopping place.

Example:
```
python tools/output/computeStoppingPlaceUsage.py -s stopinfos.xml
```

## computePassengerCounts.py
This tool reads stop-output and generates occupancy-over-time for vehicles
A distinct output file will be created for each vehicle.

Example:
```
python tools/output/computePassengerCounts.py -s stopinfos.xml
```

## parkingSearchTraffic.py
This tool reads [vehroute-output](../Simulation/Output/VehRoutes.md) with [exit-times](../Simulation/Output/VehRoutes.md#further_options) and generates statistics for the time and the distance vehicles
spent on searching parking locations as well as the length of the walking way back.
It evaluates the time and distance between the first reroute and the arrival at the final stop.
It currently outputs only basic statistics (mean, avg, quartiles etc.).

Example:
```
python tools/output/parkingSearchTraffic.py net.net.xml vehroutes.xml
```


## aggregateBatteryOutput.py

Script for aggregate battery outputs in intervals.

Example usage:
```
python tools\output\aggregateBatteryOutput.py -i battery.xml -o batteryAggregatedx.xml -t 60 -v veh0')
```
