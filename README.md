## Investigating Q-Learning and DQN variants for Traffic Signal Control problem

</div>

### Abstract 
Traffic Signal Control is an urgent problem that needs to be solved in big cities where traffic jams often occur. This will help people reduce travel time on the road, save fuel in the context of increasing gasoline prices and reduce CO2 emissions into the environment. Reinforcement Learning is one of the popular methods used to solve this problem. In this article, we will experiment with Q-Learning and 4 variants of DQN, observing their results with 6 different metrics. Our goal is to investigate the performance of these algorithms in an environment with 16 intersections. The results we obtained show that while Q-Learning is simple, it is surprisingly effective, which is promising for the application of Q-Learning to the Traffic Signal Control problem in practice.
